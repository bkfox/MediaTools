# MediaTools
This project is experimental and don't have the pretention to be one day
an application.

Its goal is to provide a common framework to develop scripts for my everyday uses:
- Run commands executing actions;
- Batch of commands sharing the same context and data (eg: one command to select file, others to manipulate selection);
- Argument parsing specific to each command;
- Edit pre-filled commands list from text editor then run;

Wanted:
- Files: base file management (move, extract, etc.);
- Music: extract and compress, fix playlist, tags update;
- Backup: do backup;
